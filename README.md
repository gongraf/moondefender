# About
Small game created to be executed in the webview of an Android app I was working on around 2015/2016.
I have removed all the touch events and added the keyboard events as well as a small gamepad library I coded.
I am making this game public exactly as I coded long ago.
All the graphics were created by me using the old good Graphics Gale. I am not a pixel artist so don't expect professional work in that regard. 

## Install
Just clone or download the zip and double click on defend.html
